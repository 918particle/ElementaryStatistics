\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This course will follow the standard methodology of elementary statistics taught regularly during Fall and Spring semesters. Concepts of descriptive statistics will be presented, including descriptive measures, probability concepts, discrete random variables, and the normal distribution. Concepts of inferential statistics will also be presented, including sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, chi-squared procedures, and linear regression. This version of the course will provide interactive learning techniques designed to augment the online learning experience, and the course textbook will be free.  Time-permitting, the use of computer programming tools to help visualize examples will be covered.

\textit{\textbf{Office hours}: Fridays from 8:00-12:00, via \textbf{Discord}.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Attendance/Absence}: Students are required to log in for the morning Zoom sessions, however the asynchronous content may be digested on the students' individual schedules}.\\ 
\textit{\textbf{Late work policy}: Late work is generally not accepted, but is left to the discretion of the instructor.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Text}: Introductory Statistics - \url{https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics} The text is open-access, and therefore free online, and via the OpenStax app on iOS and Android.  High-quality PDF is available.} \\
\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be one midterm, homework assignments, and daily warm-up quizzes.  Homework is from the open-access textbook, submitted via Moodle.  Finally, there will be a self-designed project and presentation given at the end of the term.  Daily warm-up quizzes are graded for completion, like taking attendance. See Table \ref{tab:grades} for grading percentages.} \\

\end{enumerate}
\1 \textit{Final Project and Presentation details:}
Students will perform data collection and analysis on a topic of their choice, with the goal of establishing a linear correlation.  Often times this portion of the project is more art than science, since many experiments do not turn out a linear dependence.  Students must submit a \textit{project summary} by July 31st, 2020 so that the instructor may modify it or make suggestions.  The data should be collected, along with statistical errors on the measurements.  Students will then perform a linear regression on the data, and attempt to make a sound statistical prediction using the regression.  The final presentation should be 7-12 slides in PDF or PowerPoint format, which will be presented remotely to the class via Zoom in the final week of class.  In addition to the technical correctness of the conclusions, students will be assessed on the clarity of the presentation.  \textbf{As such, the instructor will provide practice sessions, training, and advice on presentation of the topic by appointment with the students.}
