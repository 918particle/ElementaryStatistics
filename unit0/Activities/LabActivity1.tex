\section{Introduction}

Steven Levitt is one of the authors of the book Freakonomics.  In this TED talk, he explains a statistical analysis done on data from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.  Pay close attention to the specific data sets used in his presentation.

Answer the following questions and submit as a PDF file to jhanson2@whittier.edu.

\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the \textit{proportional data} listed for car-seats and different types of seat belt. \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Around minute 12:00, the speaker shows a graph of raw data of the ``reduction of fatalities due to car seats, lap-and-shoulder seat belts, and lap-only seat-belts.''  Explain how these numbers are 0.1, 0.11, and 0.12, approximately.  Where do these numbers come from on the previous slide? \\ \vspace{2 cm}
\item At the end of the talk, the speaker is asked a question about \textit{injuries} rather than \textit{fatalities}.  How does he argue that seat belts are just as effective as car seats for children above the age of 2?  What statistic does he quote for the New Jersey data sample?
\end{enumerate}
