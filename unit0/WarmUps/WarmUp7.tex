\section{Understanding the Two Rules of Probability}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a \textit{fair coin} where the probability of a heads, P(H), is 0.5, and the probability of a tails, P(T), is 0.5 as well.  What is the probability of the following sequence: HHTTHHTT? \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item What is the probability of flipping a HTT OR a THH? \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item What is the probability of flipping a HT, AND then a TH? \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item What is the probaility of flipping a HT AND a TH, OR a TTH AND a HTT?
\end{enumerate}
