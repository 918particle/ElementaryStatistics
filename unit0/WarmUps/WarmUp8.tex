\section{Understanding the Two Rules of Probability}

Carlos plays college soccer. He makes a goal 65\% of the time he shoots. Carlos is going to attempt two goals in a row in the next game. A = the event Carlos is successful on his first attempt. P(A) = 0.65. B = the event Carlos is successful on his second attempt. P(B) = 0.65. Carlos tends to shoot in streaks. The probability that he makes the second goal \textit{given} that he made the first goal is 0.90.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that he makes both goals?
\item What is the probability that Carlos makes either the first goal or the second goal?
\item Are A and B independent?
\item Are A and B mutually exclusive?
\end{enumerate}
