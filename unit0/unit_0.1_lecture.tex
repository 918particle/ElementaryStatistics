\textbf{COVID-19 data.}  In a March 2020 article in the magazine \texttt{wired.com}, Ferris Jabr points out that people were drawing comparisons between the influenza pandemic of 1918 and SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19).  The \alert{case fatality rate}, or CFR, is the percentage of people who contract the disease that perish from it.  In the 1918 outbreak, it is usually stated that there were approximately 500 million infections, 50-100 million fatalities, and an overall CFR of 2.5\%.  What is interesting is that the coronavirus seems to have a CFR (averaged over age) of $\approx 3$ \%, making it ... \textit{higher}. \\ \vspace{0.5 cm}
Question 1: The above paragraph listed four pieces of data.  What are they? \\

Question 2: Which number, if any, seems to have a problem?
\begin{itemize}
\item A: The total number of infections in 1918
\item B: The total number of deaths in 1918
\item C: The 1918 influenza CFR
\item D: The 2020 coronavirus CFR

\textit{Vocabulary}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Probability}: The extend to which something is \textit{likely} to occur, measured by the ratio of favorable cases to the whole number of cases possible.
\item \textbf{Population}: The total collection of people, objects, or cases under investigation.
\item \textbf{Sample}: A subset of the population for which statistical data is collected.
\item \textbf{Statistic}: \textit{A statistic} is a number that represents a property of the sample.  For example: the CFR of a \textit{sample} of 2,500 coronavirus patients.
\item \textbf{Parameter}: Statistic measured from the \textit{entire} population.  A statistic attempts to reveal knowledge of a parameter.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Topics from Chapter 1}
\small
\textit{Vocabulary}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Representative sample}: a sample that captures all of the properties of a population. Counter-example: psychological studies using undergraduate subjects.
\item \textbf{Variable}: A property of each member of the population that can be determined, either quantitative or categorical. \textbf{Data} are the actual values.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Topics from Chapter 1}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!10,colframe=orange!100,title=Mean: Definition 1]
Let X represent a \textit{variable} of a \textit{population}, and $x_i$ represent the actual value of the i-th member of a statistical \textit{sample} of that \textit{population}.  The arithmetic mean $\bar{x}$ of the \textit{sample} for that property is
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^{N} x_i
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}
The mean of the variable X is the number $\bar{x}$ from the sample.

\section{Interactive Questions}

\begin{frame}{Interactive Questions}
Almost always, we will give multiple-choice questions with answers A-D.  If you are lost, or need extra explanation, or just feel we are going to fast, select the letter E.  E stands for WAT...
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/wat.pdf}
\end{figure}
After 1 round, we examine the \textit{answer distribution}, and if 70\% get it right, we move on.  Otherwise, we discuss via chat with each other, explaining why we picked our answer.  Then we have round 2.  Remember to hit E if you are confused.

\begin{frame}{Sampling Strategies}
\alert{Sampling Strategies:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple random ... how to generate random numbers? (Good project).
\item Stratified sampling: pre-defined groups, choose proportionately at random from those groups (choosing at random from Depts.)
\item Cluster sampling: pre-defined groups, but choose \textit{the groups themselves} at random (choose random Depts.)
\item Systematic sampling: select every n-th subject in the population to form the sample (assume some ordering, could be random)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sampling Strategies}
\textbf{Cool example on random sampling.}  How can you measure the number of fish in a pond?  Catch all the fish?  No way!  Use simple random sampling.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Catch $n$ fish, and mark them.
\item Return one day later, and catch $n$ fish again.
\item Assume the sample of fish is \textit{simple random}.  Why is this a good or bad assumption?
\item Measure the number $m$ of marked fish, caught the second day.
\item The \textit{proportion of total fish that are marked} is $p = m/n$.
\item But, $p = n/N$, where $N$ is the total...
\item $N = n/p = n^2/m$. \vspace{0.5cm} \footnote{Proceed to Hawai'i to tag great white sharks...}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sampling Strategies}
\textbf{Cool example on random sampling.}  How can you measure the number of fish in a pond?  Catch all the fish?  No way!  Use simple random sampling.
\begin{enumerate}
\item With replacement ... keeps the population unchanged, randomness preserved.
\item Without replacement ... changes the population by 1 with each choice.  Often more convenient and does not matter as long as the sample size is ``large enough.''
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sampling Strategies}
\alert{Systematic sampling}, special case: waveform data, time-series data.  Systmatic trends cannot be observed by data sampled insufficiently systematically.

\alert{How frequently do data values occur in the sample?}
An activity to demonstrate the concept of frequency. \\ \vspace{0.5cm}
\url{https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/plinko-probability}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Frequency, Relative Frequency}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Begin with the Intro tab to this PhET simulation.
\item Use the controls at upper right to drop balls through the Plinko system.
\item Notice how they have \textit{more or less} an equal chance of bouncing to the left or right at each level.
\item This behavior of being equally likely leads to a variation in the frequency with which objects land in the areas below.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Frequency, Relative Frequency}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
\item Now click the Lab tab at the bottom center of the screen.
\item Use the controls at right to increase the rows to 26.
\item Leave the ``binary probability'' set to 0.5, meaning 50\% chance left, 50\% chance right, at each interaction.
\item We have encountered how to calculate the mean $\bar{x}$ from a data sample.  The mean position of all the balls is given at bottom right.
\item Use the play button at top right to drop 1,000 balls to form a data sample of positions at the bottom.
\item When you reach 1000, copy the \textit{bins} (0, ... , 26) and the \textit{frequencies} (the data in the bins) into Excel or LibreOffice Calc.  Put the bin numbers in column A, and the frequencies the adjacent column B.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Frequency, Relative Frequency}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose you want to sum the frequencies.  In a cell below the column of frequency data, type
\begin{verbatim}
=SUM(B1:B27)
\end{verbatim}
and hit enter.  This assumes that your data is in column B, in cells 1 through 27.
\item This should be the $N$ value given by the PhET simulation (close to 1000).
\item In column C, cell 1, type
\begin{verbatim}
=B1/N
\end{verbatim}
Instead of $N$, though, type the result for $N$ found above.
\item Click on cell C1, and drag the little black square at the bottom right of the cell down until you reach C27 (repeats the calculation).
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Frequency, Relative Frequency}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
\item Column C data are known as \textit{relative frequencies.}  They represent the probability of discovering a data result with the bin value.
\item If you use the SUM function to sum the relative frequencies, what result is obtained?
\item What about a ``running total'' of relative frequencies, to keep track of how quickly we approach 100\% of the data?  In cell D1, type
\begin{verbatim}
=C1
\end{verbatim} 
and in cell D2, type
\begin{verbatim}
=C2+D1
\end{verbatim}
Click and drag to repeat the calculation until you reach the last cell.  This trick adds the new C value to the running total. Create a plot of bin value versus column D.
\item Column D is the \textit{cumulative frequency} of the data sample.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Topics from Chapter 1}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=orange!10,colframe=orange!100,title=Mean: Definition 2]
Let X represent a statistical variable, and $x_i$ represent the data values.  Suppose there are $n_i$ instances of $x_i$, with only $M$ unique values.  The $n_i$ are the \textit{frequencies}, and we can write
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^{M} n_i x_i
\end{equation}
Moving the $1/N$ inside the sum, we see that
\begin{equation}
\bar{x} = \sum_i^{M} \left(\frac{n_i}{N}\right) x_i = \sum_i^{M} f_i x_i
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}
The fraction $f_i = n_i/N$ are the relative frequencies.  (Professor: do an example).
