\section{Introduction}

Please watch the video entitled ``Binomial Distributions'' on Moodle.

\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using LibreOffice Calc, or Excel, follow along with the example derivation of the two claims about the binomial distribution. \\ \vspace{1cm}
\item Increase the number of runs to 20.  What is the effect on $\mu$ and $\sigma$? \\ \vspace{2cm}
\item Create a histogram of $p(x)$ (normalized) versus $x$ for the 20 runs.  What does the PDF resemble?  Does this shape look familiar? \\ \vspace{3cm}
\item Try plotting the wage data from Tab. 1 of Unit 1.1 lecture notes (see Moodle page) on the same style graph as the binomial distribution with $n = 10$, and $p = q = 0.5$.  How do they look similar or different?
\end{enumerate}
